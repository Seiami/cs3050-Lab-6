## Running Instructions

# To run my programs:

    1. Ensure you are in the lab6_submission/src directory.
    2. Ensure you are working in a Linux terminal (e.g., WSL)
    3. Type "make" into the command line and hit enter.
    
    This will run 3 examples for Task 1.1 and 2 examples for Task 1.2.

    All example graphs can be found in the "tests" folder.

    I spent at least 10 hours completing this lab, so I hope it meets the desired requirements.
